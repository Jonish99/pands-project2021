The Iris data set is a data science standard for training and demonstration. "What most people know about the Iris dataset is that it has records on the length and width measures for sepals and petals. It was originally created by Dr. Edgar Anderson. This dataset consists of 50 records for each of three Iris species: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor." (The Iris Dataset — A Little Bit of History and Biology, 2021). It was Sir Ronal Aylmer Fisher who origially used this data set to able to distinguish between the three species of Iris. However, as a side note, Fisher's statistical analysis is less useful than the morphology of the diffent seeds of these plants noted by Anderson.

Fishers data set is in fact statical analysis and this lends itself to anlysis in Python. data structures such as a disctionary on a Pandas dataframe. This project will demonstrate how the dataset works and how Python can be used to illustrate this.

Variables.
The Variables used to differetiate the clas of IRs are sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width.
The class of Iris is also a variable

# note


### The plan will in continuous development during the life of the project, however the final stages will remain in place for submission

1. Research phase
2. Prototyping -
    create analysis py and use it to investigate the dataset.
3. Refining and enhnancing. 
    Clean code, make it more efficient.
    What more can we say about the Iris dataset?
